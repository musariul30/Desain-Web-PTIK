        <h1>Welcome to PTIK</h1>
        <p>Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,<br>

            Studying at the undergraduate level will be a novel experience for students that just passed Senior High School level. It will be a milestone for those who seek knowledge, skill, and a determined path of their future career. Unpreparedness and uncertainty will be daunting for new students that have got used to learning in a more structured environment. <br>
            
            The curriculum reflects our effort to keep up teaching and learning material with the rapid technology growth, while maintaining pedagogy and instructional requirements to the highest quality. The curriculum development involves practitioners, educational experts, and graduatesâ€™ users from Industry and schools alike to obtain industry insight that is embedded into the curriculum. 
            
            We encourage students to actively participate in local, national, and international events to expose them to the social, academic, and research community in information technology that they will be joining soon after graduating from the reputable institution. 
            
            Established in 2012, the Informatics Education Department, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Universitas Sebelas Maret remain in its infancy. However, the faculty achievement, network of expertise with users in Schools and Industry alike, encourage us to be more confident that success is a result of the effort of solid teamwork. 
            
            May Allah almighty bless us with guidance and perseverance to pursue our success. <br>
            
            Wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.</p>
